# NYT-clone
This repository is created to clone the New York Times page. The original page can be found [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0). The main objective of this project is to learn about positioning different elements. This project was done by me as a practice project and later pushed to GitHub.
